#### <ins>Project 1 : Balancing the load using HAProxy and transferring traffic to two microservices</ins>.

- In this project, we will learn how to balance the traffic load to more than microservices based on a simple Round-Robin.

Example:

  * Hit 1  → Forward to the 1st microservice.
 
  * Hit 2 →  Forward to the 2nd microservice.

#### <ins>Project 2: Reverse Proxy using (Two Dockerized Microservices and one Nginx container )</ins>.

 - In this project, we will learn how to reverse proxy to two microservices 

 - Example: 

   /app1  → forward to the 1st microservice
   /app2 → forward to the 2nd microservice

#### <ins>Project 3: Separation between CI and CD is significant</ins>. 

-> Independent Changes (change the k8s replica number doesn't need a change in the code ) 
 
* Same CI flow using Jenkins and GitHub Actions. 
* CI Repository: https://github.com/zeineldin/Java-tes...
* CD Repository: https://github.com/zeineldin/Java-tes...
