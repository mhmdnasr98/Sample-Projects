Example:

  * Hit 1  → Forward to the 1st microservice.
 
  * Hit 2 →  Forward to the 2nd microservice.

#### <ins>Project 3: Separation between CI and CD is significant</ins>. 

-> Independent Changes (change the k8s replica number doesn't need a change in the code ) 
 
* Same CI flow using Jenkins and GitHub Actions. 
* CI Repository: https://github.com/zeineldin/Java-tes...
* CD Repository: https://github.com/zeineldin/Java-tes...
